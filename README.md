Currency-Converter
==================

Coding Sample Details:

Please write an Objective-C app that:
- Runs on an iOS device or in Simulator
- Converts a user-entered number from one currency to another
- Does not use third-party source code (for example, code found on github)

Some other things you may consider implementing:
- Multiple conversions (from one currency into multiple)
- Images (such as a picture of the currency or a country flag)
- Formatted values to account for currency symbols, positive and negative amounts, and so on 
- Real-time currency conversion rates
- Related Wikipedia content
- Unit tests

Your coding sample will be judged on criteria such as app architecture, design, maintainability, and use of modern technologies.

I have implemented all of the possible extensions except the related Wikipedia content and the unit tests.
